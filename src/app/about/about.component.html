      <h1>About the company</h1>
      <p>
        <span class="introduction">
        West IT Consulting AB was founded in June, 2017 by me, Jonas Karlsson. The idea behind the
        company is to provide
        IT consulting services. The base for the company is in Gothenburg, Sweden.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        My career started at WM-data (Logica -> CGI) and after 4 years I moved to Capgemini and stayed there for 8
        years.
        This means I have > 10 years of experience as a developer and Solution Architect. I enjoy booth frontend and
        backend technologies and test driven development in a continuous delivery manner are fundamentals for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I prefer a role where I have time for coding but also to take responsibility in the overall solution, including
        tight communication with the customer, creating design proposals, giving estimates and even do the scrum master
        work.
      </p>
      <p>
        My main personal characteristics are my high ambition, loyalty and a pragmatic approach in designing solutions
        that are optimal for the customer.

      <h2>Customer satisfaction</h2>
      <p>
        <span class="introduction">The most important thing.</span></p>
      <p>
        During my years at Capgemini, all my external
        assignments was yearly rated by the customer through a Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) survey. During the 5
        years with external customers, the response from was (1-5 scale), 4, 5, 5, 5, 5. This means that the work has
        been
        done much beyond expectations. </p>
      <p>
        On my last project on Capgemini, where no CSI was applicable, the following was
        said by my PM about my performance:</p>

      <div class="quotation">
        <p>
          â€œ"Jonas played a key role in setting up and developing the application for SKF. The work involved
          architecture,
          development, requirement digestion etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jonas deep knowledge made him the backbone of all development in the project. As a senior he also assisted and
          helped other developers in the team. As a PM I relied on Jonas in technical discussions and found him very
          competent and experienced. A Solution Architect to trust and rely on."
