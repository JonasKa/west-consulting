          Hi, I’m Jonas Karlsson, a Solution architect and developer from Gothenburg, Sweden.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started West Consulting, or westc, in June 2017. My IT career started at WM-data (Logica -> CGI) at 2005 and
          after 4 years I moved to Capgemini and stayed there for 8 years after starting my own business.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means > 10
          years of experience as a developer and Solution Architect.

          I enjoy booth frontend and backend technologies and test driven development in a continuous delivery manner

        <p>
          I prefer a role where I have time for coding but also to take responsibility in the overall solution,
          including tight communication with the customer, creating design proposals, giving estimates and even do the
          scrum master work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Independently of what technology or what type of system I’m involved in building, I always have great customer
