/*
  These are styles that affect the entire application. They are applied to the root level component with style scoping turned off,
  meaning they will affect the entire Angular application.

  Variables, functions and mixins are not defined here. Although this CSS affects the entire app, that is only the _compiled CSS_,
  not the SCSS - meaning that pre-compilation SCSS-helpers such as variables and mixins defined here will not be available for
  use in other components. Thus, such helpers must be defined in vsm-shared/styles/shared.scss, so that they can be imported
  and used globally.
