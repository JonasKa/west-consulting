# west-consulting

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.12.

## Pre req
Installed nvm with these links:
https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating

Usage:

`nvm install 12`

`nvm ls`

`nvm use 12`

Updated `/Users/jonas/.zshrc` with export NVM_SYMLINK_CURRENT=true which exposes
latest node version under 
`/Users/jonas/.nvm/current -> /Users/jonas/.nvm/versions/node/v10.16.3`

This is pointed out as Node interpreter in IDEA.

## Deploy instructions
1. ng build (if problem with node-sass. Re install it as proposed)
2. Connect with FTP (FileZilla on my Mac) and the westc.se user
3. Update all the files, but ensure keep the .htaccess to ensure refresh of sub page
